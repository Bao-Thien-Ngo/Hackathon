## Data Source
For this project, we will utilize the [UCF Crime Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/odins0n/ucf-crime-dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/75v5ehq4cdg5g5g/AABvnJSwZI7zXb8_myBA0CLHa?dl=0)https://www.dropbox.com/sh/75v5ehq4cdg5g5g/AABvnJSwZI7zXb8_myBA0CLHa?dl=0).
The UCF-Crime Dataset contains a collection of surveillance videos capturing anomalous and normal activities. Each video clip is labeled with information about the type of anomalous event or normal, providing a suitable foundation for training and evaluating our real-time anomaly detection system.
